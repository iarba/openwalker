server - handles multiple grids
       - accepts inputs and outputs grid state/state transition.

grid - fixed size. basically a matrix. cells have properties
     - has a list of objects
     - executes events

structure - has a grid position.
          - has a grid size
          - executes scripts
          - has a context - sees the grid object                                                      V

walker - has a position, not necessarily a grid position.                                             V
       - moves in 8 directions                                                                        V
       - executes scripts
       - has a context - sees the grid object                                                         V

order - load structures -> update grid from scratch
      - load walkers -> update their paths, positions, etc
      - execute structures scripts
      - execute walker scripts
      - execute events
